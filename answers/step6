# That was tricky, wasn't it! The examples given on the website are 'httpd', which is very close!       #
# But you have to change it to 'apache2' because that is the name of the package in Ubuntu land.        #
#                                                                                                       #
# Something that can be confusing here is the two "name" parameters in each task. The first one has     #
# no effect on the outcome of the task. It is simply your description of the task being run. It is,     #
# however, extremely important in terms of documenting your playbooks. Both you and other users of      #
# your playbooks in the future will either thank or curse you based on the quality of your descriptions.#
# I like to use use full sentences to give the user the best possible picture of what the task at hand. #
# The second "name" parameter in the tasks above is (in this case) the name of the service being        #
# configured.                                                                                           #
#                                                                                                       #
# This is what you'll be doing often with Ansible: taking what is provided as an example, and           #
# then adapting it for what you need. This can be difficult at first, but much easier than decoding a   #
# shell script in my opinion. Good work! Let's keep going...                                            #
#                                                                                                       #
