# Ansible Tutorial

Feel free to reach out! Always happy to help.

## Get Started
When you are ready to begin the tutorial, open the [tutorial instructions file](Tutorial_Instructions.md) and follow the step-by-step instructions there. Good luck!

## Goal
First-time introduction to Ansible. A walk-through creating some basic Ansible content and then using Ansible to deploy a basic simulated website. 

## Difficulty Level
Beginner - This was created to be as simple as possible while still giving you some room to fail and learn from mistakes. A basic understanding of the command line is necessary to use Ansible. This tutorial provides necessary commands along the way though, so don't worry if you're a newbie. The instructions are as explicit as possible in what exactly needs to be done, and then gradually becomes more hands-off as it progresses.

## Supported Operating Systems
* Ansible runs in the command line of a Mac or Linux workstation (your laptop/desktop computer or a virtual machine).

## Summary
* First, we'll install Ansible.
* Normally, we would then configure a remote server to host your website. This tutorial will use a local Docker container to simulate a remote server.
* Next, walk through the creation of some very basic Ansible content.
* Then, run Ansible and debug any problems.
* Visit your new website.
* Optionally, try some more advanced Ansible configurations.
* Finally, clean-up.
